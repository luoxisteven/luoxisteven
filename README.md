### Personal Philosophy

- I enjoy the feeling of earning a living while doing something I love, knowing that it also contributes to my future. 
- I have a strong desire to continuously learn and systemize my knowledge base. 
It's almost like having OCD when it comes to knowledge — I feel a sense of loss if my understanding of something isn't complete or well-organized.
- My approach to learning is similar to Breadth-First Search (BFS), which I call Breadth-First Learning. I’m not concerned about the depth at first because, over time, BFS will naturally lead to a deeper understanding.
- I really like to map any knowledge into the real world. I love the SECI knowledge management framework by Ikujiro Nonaka. In his theory, knowledge exists in two forms: 1) Implicit Knowledge, and 2) Explicit Knowledge. These forms are transformable. 
This framework teaches us how to derive insights from both what is known and what cannot be easily expressed.
- I love machine learning especially reinforce learning. 
I have a strong understanding that reinforcement learning is rooted in real-world scenarios, and it uses numerical calculations to determine how to make optimal decisions.
- My ultimate goal is to build a good family in the future. Right now, I don’t feel like I have a good family—our family members live separately without a unified mindset, and we don’t know how to contribute to happiness rather than creating pressure and unhappiness. I truly understand the concept of happiness without material wealth (though I don’t doubt the importance of financial stability).
- I will continuously update my personal philosophy here....
